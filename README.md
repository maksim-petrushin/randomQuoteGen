## API Key
Note: 
- To run this project on your local machine, you will need to register with https://api-ninjas.com/register
- Once you register you will be given your API key (this key is unique to each user, this is their way of controlling that each user makes a limited amount of API calls to them.)
- In this project directory's src folder, create file APIkey.js
- In that file paste this code:
  ```javascript
  export default function getMyAPIKey(){
    return "asdasdasd";
    }
  ```
- Instead of "asdasdasd" paste your API key that you are given once registering with the cite above. (Also put it in quotation marks, as this is a JS string.)
